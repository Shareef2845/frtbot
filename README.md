<h1>Azure Chatbot with QnA Maker</h1>

<h2>Project Statement</h2>
Interacting with someone before visiting the hospital would be more helpuful for patients. If some agent can record the patients data and what problems and symtomes they are facing before they can be sent to consult a doctor would be more beneficial and time saving task for the management. In this project we made an attempt to interact with the patient to know thier health condition and this can be solved using chatbots.

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This Chatbot uses the technology of Azure QnA Maker Service that helps in creation of the knowledge base for this bot. This QnA maker extracts the information from various trusted health sites that it will be using to answer the queries typed by the users. Now the Azure Chatbot Service will be used to publish the bot created using the QnA knowledge base. Through this service, a basic chatbox is created which can answer queries on various platforms such as twitter, etc.
